# üåä POOLS - AI-Powered NFT Fractional Ownership

![POOLS Auto-Investment](auto-invest.png)

## üéØ Our Mission

At POOLS, our mission is to make NFTs accessible by letting people buy together through fractional ownership. But one challenge we kept facing is how much time it takes to gather interest from multiple users at the same time.

That's why, during the hackathon, we built an AI chatbot that sets up pools for you. Instead of chasing friends or waiting for group chats to move, you can simply tell the AI agent which collection you like. If your budget isn't enough, the AI automatically creates a pool, starts matching you with others and invest for you.

The real goal is to make these AI agents talk to each other. They share demand across the platform, bring in other users, and accelerate the funding process. What used to take hours or days can now happen instantly.

## üöÄ Key Features

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI
- **Blockchain**: Shape Network (Ethereum-compatible)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 Integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## üîó Smart Contracts

For this project, we exported our smart contracts from Ethereum to Shape Network.

**Smart Contracts on Shape Network:**

- [Pool Factory Contract](https://sepolia.shapescan.xyz/address/0x7b1B4090fb7bEa28B7E7B08AfE1572AE5CB35098)
- [Fractional Ownership Contract](https://sepolia.shapescan.xyz/address/0x8e0C4fB549f500ED2a20340CeB8BA385A732491D)

## üéØ How It Works

1. **User Interaction**: Users chat with our AI agent about NFT collections they're interested in
2. **AI Analysis**: The AI analyzes the collection, checks prices, and determines if pooling is beneficial
3. **Pool Creation**: If beneficial, the AI automatically creates a pool for the collection
4. **Investment Execution**: Once the pool reaches the target, the AI automatically invests in the NFT
5. **Fractional Ownership**: Users receive fractional ownership tokens representing their share
